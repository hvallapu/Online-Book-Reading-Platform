# Online-Book-Reading-Platform
The Online Book Store is an E-learning platform that provides customers to read any book online by creating an account in the application.  In this system, the developer provides an account to every user and a limited book stock to every user. Here the developer may also apply a payment gateway to earn some money by deciding the price for every book. Here we can also provide other functionality like the translation of the book into another language. The application is very eye-catching to the students and book lovers who love to read books but can’t carry books everywhere. The application provides anytime anywhere facility to the user. Java provides libraries to handle large amounts of data and we are sure that if you start creating this project you are really going to upgrade yourself.
